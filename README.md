# Python Loops Notes

Loops allow you to repeat a process either a given number of times or until something happens.

For example: 
```
while (student is hungry and pretzels are present)
      eat another pretzel
```
We are going to look at 2 types of loops
* while loops
* for loops

A while loop is a block of code associated with a condition.  As long as the condition is true, the loop will continue to run the block of code.
```python
while (boolean condition):
    doSomething
    doSomethingElse
```

```python
for z in range(5):
    print z
```
